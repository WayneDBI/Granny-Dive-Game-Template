GRANNY DIVE is a vertical scrolling, cliff dodging, base jumping template built around the Corona SDK. The download includes the full source code to the game, along with 36 demo levels and our level editor. We’ve kept the gameplay mechanics nice and simple too. Simply tap the LEFT or RIGHT hand side of the screen to move our hero around. Collect the coins and bonuses as you fall.

To spice things up we’ve created multiple obstacles for you to avoid on your way down, but to help out – we’ve also added a great ZOOM-IN and SLOW MOTION power up. Collect this and the game slows down.. Even the music slows down, giving you a chance to catch your breath.. It doesn’t last long though – so make it count, before the music speeds back up and you start falling even faster!.

To land our hero safely, you’ll need to tap her as she enters the PARACHUTE ZONE, do it right and she’ll deploy her panty-hose (you might want to add or use a parachute maybe?).. Get it right and she’ll glide down gracefully – leaving you to carefully land on the target base on the ground.. Get it wrong – OOPS! she’ll plummet to her death, break her neck and float up to heaven.
